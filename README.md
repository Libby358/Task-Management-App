# Task Management App - Requirements Specification

## 1. Project Overview

The Task Management App is a web-based application that allows users to create, organize, and track their tasks. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the application.

## 2. User Stories

### Authentication
- As a user, I want to register with email and password
- As a user, I want to log in to access my tasks
- As a user, I want to log out of the application
- As a user, I want to reset my password if forgotten

### Task Management
- As a user, I want to create new tasks with a title and description
- As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a list
- As a user, I want to update task details
- As a user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete
- As a user, I want to set due dates for tasks
- As a user, I want to assign priority levels to tasks (Low, Medium, High)
- As a user, I want to categorize tasks with labels or tags

### Organization & Filtering
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by completion status
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by priority level
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by due date
- As a user, I want to search for tasks by title or description
- As a user, I want to sort tasks by different criteria (date created, due date, priority)

### Dashboard
- As a user, I want to see a summary of my tasks (total, completed, overdue)
- As a user, I want to see upcoming due dates for the week
- As a user, I want to see a visual representation of my task completion

## 3. Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Modern UI with intuitive navigation
- Form validation for all user inputs
- Loading states for asynchronous operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Backend
- RESTful API design
- Secure authentication with JWT
- Data validation for all API endpoints
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Database integration

### Database
- Store user information securely
- Store task data with relationships to users
- Support for filtering and searching operations

## 4. API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register - Create a new user account
- POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate user and generate token
- POST /api/auth/logout - Invalidate user token
- POST /api/auth/reset-password - Send password reset email

### Tasks
- GET /api/tasks - Retrieve all tasks for logged-in user
- GET /api/tasks/:id - Retrieve a specific task
- POST /api/tasks - Create a new task
- PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update an existing task
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete a task
- PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete - Mark a task as complete

### Tags/Categories
- GET /api/tags - Retrieve all tags for logged-in user
- POST /api/tags - Create a new tag
- PUT /api/tags/:id - Update a tag
- DELETE /api/tags/:id - Delete a tag

## 5. Data Models

### User
- id: UUID (primary key)
- email: String (unique)
- password: String (hashed)
- name: String
- created_at: Timestamp
- updated_at: Timestamp

### Task
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key)
- title: String
- description: Text
- status: Enum (pending, completed)
- priority: Enum (low, medium, high)
- due_date: Date
- created_at: Timestamp
- updated_at: Timestamp

### Tag
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key)
- name: String
- color: String (hex code)

### TaskTag (for many-to-many relationship)
- task_id: UUID (foreign key)
- tag_id: UUID (foreign key)

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API responses within 500ms for standard operations
- Support for at least 100 concurrent users
- Support for users with up to 1000 tasks

### Security
- Password hashing with bcrypt or similar
- HTTPS for all communications
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- Consistent design language throughout the application
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Clear feedback for user actions

## 7. Deployment

- Containerization with Docker
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Environment configuration for development, testing, and production

## 8. Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for backend business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend component testing
- End-to-end testing for critical user flows
- Performance testing for API endpoints

## 9. Future Enhancements (v2)

- Collaborative tasks and sharing
- Recurring tasks
- Email notifications for due dates
- File attachments for tasks
- Time tracking for tasks
- Task dependencies
